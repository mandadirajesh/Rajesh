-->AutoSys is a job scheduling tool used in Unix/Linux and Windows. It is commonly used for scheduling, monitoring, and executing jobs in large IT environments.

-->KEY FEATURES IN AUTOSYS
	-->Job Scheduling – Automates the execution of batch jobs at specified times or based on triggers.
	-->Dependency Management – Supports job dependencies (one job can start only after another completes).
	-->Event-Driven Execution – Jobs can be triggered based on events like file arrival, database updates, or system conditions.
	-->Monitoring and Alerts – Sends notifications on job failures, delays, or successes.
	-->Multiple Job Types – Supports command jobs, file watcher jobs, and box jobs (grouping multiple jobs).
	-->Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows, Linux, and Unix environments.

-->AUTOSYS JOB TYPE
	-->Command Job – Runs a script or command.
	-->File Watcher Job – Monitors the arrival, modification, or deletion of a file.
	-->Box Job – A container that holds and manages multiple jobs as a group.

-->AUTOSYS STATUS
	Status	    Meaning
	
	INACTIVE	Job is not yet scheduled.
	ACTIVATED	Job is ready to run but waiting for dependencies.
	RUNNING	    Job is currently executing.
	SUCCESS	    Job completed successfully.
	FAILURE	    Job failed.
	ON_HOLD	    Job is manually put on hold.
	TERMINATED	Job was killed manually.
	
-->JOB SCRIPT : insert_job: <job_name>
				job_type: <type>
				command: <command_to_execute>
				machine: <server_name>
				owner: <user@domain>
				start_times: "<HH:MM>"
				run_calendar: <calendar_name>


-->WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ON_HOLD AND ON_ICE?

				on hold																				on Ice
1.  If job status changed to on-hold to off-hold job will run immediately.	1. If job status changed to on-ice to off-ice job will not run immediately. Job will wait for next scheduled time.
2. Dependent jobs will not run when status changed to on hold.	2. Dependent jobs will run when status changed to on ice.
